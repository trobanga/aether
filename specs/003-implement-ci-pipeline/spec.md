# Feature Specification: GitHub CI Pipeline

**Feature Branch**: `003-implement-ci-pipeline`
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement CI Pipeline

We need to implement a CI pipeline for github.

It should check linting, run unit and integration tests, as well as spin up the test system inm @.github/test/  and run e2e tests."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automated Code Quality Validation (Priority: P1)

When a developer pushes code changes to any branch, the CI pipeline automatically runs code quality checks (linting and static analysis) to catch formatting issues, common bugs, and code smells before code review.

**Why this priority**: This is the fastest feedback loop (typically completes in under 1 minute) and catches the most common issues early, reducing reviewer burden and preventing broken code from progressing through the pipeline.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by pushing a commit with intentional linting violations and verifying the CI pipeline fails with clear error messages indicating the specific violations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer pushes code to a feature branch, **When** the code contains linting violations, **Then** the CI pipeline fails the lint check and displays specific violations with file locations and line numbers
2. **Given** a developer pushes properly formatted code, **When** the lint check runs, **Then** the pipeline passes the lint stage and proceeds to the next stage
3. **Given** a pull request is open, **When** the lint check fails, **Then** the PR is marked as "checks failed" and merge is blocked

---

### User Story 2 - Automated Unit Test Execution (Priority: P2)

When code is pushed, the CI pipeline automatically runs all unit tests to verify that individual components work correctly in isolation, providing fast feedback on logic errors and regressions.

**Why this priority**: Unit tests provide comprehensive coverage of business logic and run quickly (typically under 2 minutes). They catch regressions and logic errors before more expensive integration tests run.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by introducing a bug that breaks a unit test, pushing the code, and verifying the CI pipeline fails with test failure details including the specific test case and assertion that failed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer pushes code with a failing unit test, **When** the test suite runs, **Then** the CI pipeline fails and reports which tests failed with error details
2. **Given** all unit tests pass, **When** the test stage completes, **Then** the pipeline shows green status for the unit test stage
3. **Given** multiple commits are pushed rapidly, **When** CI is triggered, **Then** outdated pipeline runs are cancelled automatically to save resources

---

### User Story 3 - Automated Integration Test Execution with Test Services (Priority: P3)

When code is pushed, the CI pipeline spins up required test services (DIMP stack via Docker Compose), runs integration tests against these services, and then tears down the test environment, ensuring the application works correctly with external dependencies.

**Why this priority**: Integration tests verify cross-component interactions and external service integration. They take longer (5-10 minutes) but catch issues that unit tests miss, such as API contract violations and service configuration problems.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by modifying integration test code to expect incorrect behavior from the DIMP service, pushing the code, and verifying the CI pipeline successfully starts the Docker services, runs tests, reports failures, and cleans up containers regardless of test outcome.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer pushes code, **When** the integration test stage starts, **Then** the CI pipeline starts the DIMP Docker Compose services and waits for health checks to pass before running tests
2. **Given** integration tests are running, **When** a test fails, **Then** the pipeline captures service logs, reports the failure with context, and ensures all containers are stopped and removed
3. **Given** integration tests complete successfully, **When** the stage finishes, **Then** the pipeline tears down all Docker services cleanly and proceeds to the next stage
4. **Given** Docker services fail to start or health checks timeout, **When** the startup phase fails, **Then** the pipeline fails fast with clear error messages about which service failed and why

---

### User Story 4 - Automated End-to-End Test Execution (Priority: P4)

When a pull request is created or updated, and when code is merged to the main branch, the CI pipeline runs comprehensive end-to-end tests that simulate real user workflows against the fully deployed test environment, ensuring the entire system works together correctly from the user's perspective.

**Why this priority**: E2E tests provide the highest confidence that the system works as a whole and must pass before any code can be merged. While they are the slowest (10-15 minutes), running them on every PR ensures broken integrations are caught before merge, preventing main branch breakage.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a simple E2E test that runs the full pipeline workflow (start → process → complete), opening a pull request, and verifying the CI successfully orchestrates all services, executes the test workflow, and reports detailed results with logs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pull request is opened or updated, **When** the E2E stage triggers, **Then** the pipeline starts all required services and runs the complete pipeline workflow test
2. **Given** code is merged to the main branch, **When** the E2E stage triggers, **Then** the pipeline runs E2E tests to verify main branch health
3. **Given** an E2E test fails, **When** the failure occurs, **Then** the pipeline captures comprehensive logs from all services, screenshots or artifacts where applicable, and provides clear failure context
4. **Given** E2E tests complete, **When** the stage finishes, **Then** the pipeline publishes test results as job artifacts accessible from the GitHub Actions UI

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Docker services fail to start due to port conflicts or resource constraints? Pipeline should fail fast with diagnostic information.
- How does the system handle flaky tests that occasionally fail? The pipeline should rerun failed tests once to distinguish flaky from broken tests.
- What happens when multiple commits are pushed in rapid succession? Pipeline should cancel outdated runs for the same branch to conserve CI resources.
- How does the pipeline handle timeout scenarios for long-running tests? Each stage should have reasonable timeout limits (lint: 5min, unit: 10min, integration: 20min, E2E: 30min).
- What happens if test cleanup fails and Docker containers remain running? Pipeline should have force cleanup steps in the cleanup phase regardless of test outcome.
- How are secrets and credentials managed for test services? Pipeline should use GitHub Secrets for any required credentials and never commit them to the repository.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **CI Workflow**: The automated process that orchestrates all testing stages; includes trigger conditions, job definitions, and stage sequencing
- **Pipeline Stage**: A discrete phase of the CI workflow (lint, unit test, integration test, E2E test); has specific commands, timeout limits, and success/failure criteria
- **Test Service**: External dependency required for testing (e.g., DIMP stack with PostgreSQL, VFPS, FHIR Pseudonymizer); defined in Docker Compose configurations
- **Job Artifact**: Output files from the CI run (test results, logs, coverage reports); stored by GitHub Actions and accessible from the UI
- **Branch Protection Rule**: GitHub configuration that enforces CI checks before merge; links specific required status checks to branch policies
