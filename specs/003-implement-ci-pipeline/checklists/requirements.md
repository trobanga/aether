# Specification Quality Checklist: GitHub CI Pipeline

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Iteration 1: Initial Review

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- Specification maintains technology-agnostic language throughout
- Focus is on developer experience and business value (automated testing, fast feedback)
- All mandatory sections are present and complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- ✅ Requirements are testable and clear (e.g., FR-003: "run linting checks using existing make lint command")
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., SC-001: "within 3 minutes")
- ⚠️ Success criteria SC-003 and SC-009 mention some implementation aspects that should be more outcome-focused
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios are well-defined with Given/When/Then format
- ✅ Edge cases comprehensively cover failure scenarios
- ✅ Scope is bounded by explicit stage definitions and trigger conditions
- ✅ Dependencies clearly documented (Docker, existing test infrastructure)

**Issues Found**:
1. **SC-003**: "without leaving orphaned containers" - while measurable, this is slightly implementation-focused. Better as: "Test environments are completely cleaned up after each run, with no resource leaks"
2. **SC-009**: References specific technical details (file paths, line numbers). Better as: "Developers can identify and fix failures within 5 minutes of receiving CI feedback"

**Action**: Update these success criteria to be more outcome-focused.

### Iteration 2: After Corrections

All validation items now pass. The specification is ready for planning.

### User Clarification (2025-10-10)

**Question**: When should E2E tests run?
**Original assumption**: Only on main/develop/release branches to conserve resources
**Clarification**: E2E tests run on every pull request AND when PRs are merged to main

**Changes made**:
- Updated User Story 4 description and priority reasoning
- Added acceptance scenario for PR-triggered E2E tests
- Updated FR-018 to reflect PR and main branch triggers
- Removed resource conservation reasoning (E2E tests are required for all PRs)

All validation items still pass after these updates.

## Notes

- The specification leverages existing test infrastructure (`.github/test/` and Makefile commands), which reduces scope and complexity
- E2E test definition is intentionally high-level to allow flexibility in implementation approach
- Priority ordering (P1-P4) provides clear implementation sequencing: code quality → unit tests → integration tests → E2E tests
- Edge case handling is comprehensive, covering resource management, flaky tests, and timeout scenarios
