## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - **BLOCKS all user stories**
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Core TORCH functionality
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Can run in parallel with US1
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 completion (reuses TORCH client) - Lower priority
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Foundation complete ‚Üí Can start immediately - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Foundation complete ‚Üí Can run in parallel with US1 - Independent testing of existing features
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: US1 complete (needs TORCH client) ‚Üí Extends US1 with URL shortcut

### Within Each User Story

**CRITICAL TDD ORDERING**:
1. **Tests FIRST**: Write all test scenarios and ensure they FAIL
2. **User Approval**: Tests must be reviewed and approved before implementation
3. **Implementation**: Write code to make tests pass
4. **Verification**: Confirm all tests pass (RED ‚Üí GREEN)
5. **Refactor**: Clean up code while keeping tests green

**Within Implementation**:
- Models/structs before services
- Services before pipeline integration
- Core logic before error handling
- Independent components marked [P] can run in parallel

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002 and T003 can run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundation)**:
- All test tasks (T004-T009) can run in parallel
- Model extensions (T013-T014) can run in parallel after tests approved
- Validation functions (T015-T017) can run in parallel

**Phase 3 (US1)**:
- All test tasks (T020-T024) can run in parallel
- Struct definitions (T026-T029) can run in parallel after tests approved

**Phase 4 (US2)**:
- All test tasks (T046-T048) can run in parallel
- Can run entire US2 in parallel with US1 (different focus)

**Phase 5 (US3)**:
- Test tasks (T053-T054) can run in parallel

**Phase 6 (Polish)**:
- Documentation (T059-T060) can run in parallel
- Edge case handling (T065-T070) can run in parallel
- Performance tests (T071-T074) can run in parallel
- Telemetry and cleanup (T075-T076) can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Tests

```bash
# Launch all test writing tasks for US1 together (before approval):
Task: "[US1] Unit test for TORCH client SubmitExtraction()"
Task: "[US1] Unit test for TORCH client PollExtractionStatus()"
Task: "[US1] Unit test for TORCH client DownloadExtractionFiles()"
Task: "[US1] Unit test for base64 CRTDL encoding"
Task: "[US1] Unit test for exponential backoff polling logic"

# After tests approved, launch struct definitions together:
Task: "[US1] Create TORCHClient struct"
Task: "[US1] Create TORCHExtractionRequest struct"
Task: "[US1] Create TORCHExtractionResult structs"
Task: "[US1] Create TORCHParameter and related structs"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + User Story 2)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (~15 minutes)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (~2-3 hours with tests)
   - **STOP**: Get test approval before implementation
   - **VALIDATE**: All foundation tests pass
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (~4-6 hours with tests)
   - **STOP**: Get test approval before implementation
   - **VALIDATE**: CRTDL extraction works end-to-end
   - **DEPLOY/DEMO**: Core TORCH functionality ready
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (~1 hour)
   - **VALIDATE**: No regression in existing features
   - **DEPLOY/DEMO**: MVP complete with backward compatibility

**MVP Delivers**: Full TORCH CRTDL extraction + backward compatibility (US1 + US2)

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** ‚Üí Tests approved ‚Üí Implementation complete ‚Üí All tests pass
2. **MVP (US1 + US2)** ‚Üí Independent testing ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Core value delivered!)
3. **Enhancement (US3)** ‚Üí Independent testing ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Convenience feature)
4. **Polish** ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí Production ready

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Together**: Complete Setup + Foundational (write tests, get approval, implement)
2. **Split after Foundation**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (TORCH extraction)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (backward compatibility validation)
3. **After US1 complete**:
   - Developer A or B: User Story 3 (TORCH URL shortcut)
4. **Together**: Polish and cross-cutting concerns

## Task Count Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 77
- **Setup Tasks**: 3
- **Foundation Tasks**: 16 (10 tests + 6 implementation)
- **User Story 1 Tasks**: 26 (6 tests + 20 implementation)
- **User Story 2 Tasks**: 7 (3 tests + 4 verification)
- **User Story 3 Tasks**: 6 (2 tests + 4 implementation)
- **Polish Tasks**: 19

**Parallel Opportunities**: 45 tasks marked [P] can run concurrently

**Test Tasks**: 21 test tasks (must complete BEFORE implementation per TDD)

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: CRTDL file ‚Üí TORCH extraction ‚Üí NDJSON downloaded
- US2: Local directory ‚Üí files processed (existing flow)
- US3: TORCH URL ‚Üí NDJSON downloaded (no extraction)

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 + Phase 4 (US1 + US2) = 52 tasks

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files or independent components, no dependencies
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **TDD Critical**: Tests must FAIL before implementation (RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)
- **Constitution**: FP (immutability), TDD (tests first), KISS (simple patterns)
- **Each user story**: Independently completable and testable
- **Stop at checkpoints**: Validate story independently before proceeding
- **Commit frequently**: After each task or logical group
- **File paths**: All paths use internal/ and tests/ per existing project structure
- **Reuse patterns**: TORCH client mirrors dimp_client.go pattern
- **No breaking changes**: Backward compatibility is P1 requirement

---

## Next Steps

1. Review tasks with stakeholders
2. Get test scenarios approved (T004-T009, T020-T025, etc.)
3. Begin Phase 1: Setup
4. Proceed through phases sequentially or with parallel team
5. Stop at each checkpoint for independent validation
6. Target MVP = US1 + US2 for initial release
7. Add US3 as enhancement in follow-up release
