# Specification Quality Checklist: TORCH Server Data Import

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

### Details

**Content Quality**: PASSED
- Specification focuses on user workflows and business value (researchers extracting data)
- No programming language or framework mentions in requirements
- Written to be understandable by research stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: PASSED
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete
- All 14 functional requirements are testable (can verify CRTDL acceptance, authentication, polling behavior, etc.)
- Success criteria are measurable with specific outcomes (e.g., "zero disruption for existing users", "completes within 5 seconds", "configurable timeout default 30 minutes")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of Go, HTTP client libraries, etc.)
- 3 user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios cover all primary flows
- 7 edge cases identified covering error scenarios, timeouts, validation, etc.
- Scope is bounded to TORCH integration while maintaining backward compatibility
- Dependencies clearly documented (external TORCH server, internal HTTP client reuse)
- Patient-specific testing handled via adapted CRTDL files (documented in Workflow Assumptions)

**Feature Readiness**: PASSED
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- Primary flow (P1: CRTDL extraction) is fully specified with 4 acceptance scenarios
- Success criteria provide clear verification points for feature completion
- Technical assumptions kept in separate section, not mixed with requirements
- Testing approach clarified: adapted CRTDL files used for patient-specific testing rather than command-line overrides

## Updates

**2025-10-10**: Removed User Story 2 (Specific Patient Override) per user request. Testing will use adapted CRTDL files instead of command-line patient overrides. Functional requirements reduced from 15 to 14 (removed FR-009 patient override requirement).

## Recommendation

**✅ READY FOR NEXT PHASE**

This specification is complete and ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning.

No clarifications or spec updates needed.
