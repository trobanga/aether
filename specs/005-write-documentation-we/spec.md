# Feature Specification: VitePress Documentation Site

**Feature Branch**: `005-write-documentation-we`
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Write documentation. We should use vitepress for documentation, similar to Torch https://github.com/medizininformatik-initiative/torch and FTSnext https://github.com/medizininformatik-initiative/fts-next"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Set up VitePress Documentation Site (Priority: P1)

Developers and contributors need to build and deploy a professional documentation site that centralizes all user guides, API references, and development information currently scattered across README.md, specs/, and docs/ directories.

**Why this priority**: A dedicated documentation site is the foundation for all other user education. Without it, users must navigate multiple files and repositories, leading to confusion and increased support burden. This is critical for project adoption and user success.

**Independent Test**: Documentation site builds successfully with VitePress, renders all markdown content, includes navigation structure, and can be deployed to GitHub Pages. Site is accessible and searchable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh VitePress project initialized, **When** documentation markdown files are added to the docs directory, **Then** VitePress builds successfully and generates a static site with all content accessible via navigation
2. **Given** the site is deployed to GitHub Pages, **When** a user visits the documentation URL, **Then** the site loads with proper styling, navigation, and search functionality
3. **Given** a markdown file exists in the docs directory, **When** the VitePress build completes, **Then** the content is rendered correctly with proper links and code highlighting

---

### User Story 2 - Migrate and Organize Documentation Content (Priority: P2)

Users need all existing documentation consolidated into the VitePress site with logical organization that helps them find what they need quickly.

**Why this priority**: Content organization directly impacts user experience. Clear structure and categorization reduce time-to-answer and support requests. This enables P1 to deliver actual value to users.

**Independent Test**: All existing documentation is accessible from the VitePress site with improved navigation structure. Users can find content via sidebar navigation, search, or table of contents. No content is missing or broken.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** documentation exists in multiple locations (README.md, specs/, docs/), **When** content is migrated to VitePress, **Then** all content is preserved and organized by topic (installation, usage, configuration, development, API reference)
2. **Given** a user lands on the home page, **When** they browse the sidebar navigation, **Then** they can find guides organized by role (end-user, developer, operator)
3. **Given** existing internal links in documentation, **When** content is migrated, **Then** links are updated to reference the new structure without broken references

---

### User Story 3 - Configure GitHub Pages Deployment (Priority: P3)

Users need automated deployment of documentation updates to make content always current and easily accessible online.

**Why this priority**: While important for discoverability, deployment automation is secondary to having good content. P1 and P2 deliver standalone value; P3 enhances distribution.

**Independent Test**: Documentation is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages on each commit to main branch. Site version matches the deployed code version. No manual deployment steps required.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the VitePress site is ready, **When** GitHub Actions workflow is configured, **Then** site automatically builds and deploys on commits to main
2. **Given** a documentation update is pushed to main, **When** GitHub Actions completes, **Then** the change is live at the documentation URL within 2 minutes

### Edge Cases

- What happens when documentation references code examples that no longer exist in the repository?
- How are code snippets in documentation kept in sync with actual code as it evolves?
- What if a user has cached an old version of the documentation site?
- How are multiple language versions or API version docs handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support VitePress site initialization with TypeScript and Vue 3 support
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a coherent site structure with separate sections for Users, Developers, and Operators
- **FR-003**: System MUST include built-in search functionality that works across all documentation pages
- **FR-004**: System MUST render all existing markdown documentation without loss of formatting or content
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain proper cross-references between documentation pages (no broken internal links)
- **FR-006**: System MUST support syntax highlighting for code examples (Go, YAML, JSON, shell scripts)
- **FR-007**: System MUST include navigation breadcrumbs for easy orientation within documentation structure
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a home page with quick-start links to most common user journeys
- **FR-009**: System MUST support versioning of documentation tied to git tags/releases
- **FR-010**: System MUST be deployable to GitHub Pages with automated CI/CD workflow

### Key Entities

- **Documentation Site**: The VitePress application that renders and serves documentation
- **Documentation Content**: Markdown files organized by topic and user role
- **Navigation Structure**: Sidebar configuration that defines document hierarchy and organization
- **Deployment Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys to GitHub Pages
- **Search Index**: Built-in VitePress search index across all documentation content

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Documentation site loads in under 2 seconds on 4G network
- **SC-002**: Search functionality returns relevant results within 500ms
- **SC-003**: Users can navigate from home page to any documentation section in 2 clicks or fewer
- **SC-004**: 100% of existing documentation content is migrated to the site (zero broken links when internal references are updated)
- **SC-005**: Documentation builds successfully on every commit (zero build failures in CI)
- **SC-006**: Code examples in documentation are readable and properly syntax-highlighted
- **SC-007**: Site is accessible on mobile devices with responsive layout (works on screens 320px and wider)
- **SC-008**: Documentation updates are live within 3 minutes of push to main branch
- **SC-009**: Search functionality finds pages by keywords (e.g., "TORCH" returns TORCH integration guide)
- **SC-010**: At least 90% of external links in documentation resolve correctly

## Assumptions

- VitePress is the chosen documentation framework (similar to Torch and FTSnext projects)
- Documentation will be deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions
- Existing markdown files in specs/ and docs/ contain all content to be migrated
- The site will be in English only (no multi-language support in initial version)
- Documentation versioning will align with git releases/tags (not separate version branches)
- Search functionality will use VitePress's built-in search (not external services like Algolia)
- Mobile responsiveness means standard responsive design (not dedicated mobile apps)
