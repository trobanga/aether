# Tasks: VitePress Documentation Site

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-write-documentation-we/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/link-structure.md ‚úÖ

**Organization**: Tasks organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing. Tests are NOT included (not explicitly requested in feature spec - focus is on setup and content organization).

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files/directories, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- Paths follow project structure: `docs/` for source, `.github/workflows/` for automation

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Initialize VitePress project and basic structure

- [x] T001 [P] Initialize VitePress project structure per plan.md in `docs/` directory
- [x] T002 [P] Create package.json with VitePress, Vue 3, and Vite dependencies in `docs/package.json`
- [x] T003 [P] Initialize Node.js project with npm in `docs/` directory
- [x] T004 [P] Create empty directory structure in `docs/` (getting-started/, guides/, api-reference/, development/, public/assets/)
- [x] T005 Create `.vitepress/config.ts` with basic site metadata in `docs/.vitepress/config.ts`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST complete before any user story can proceed

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T006 [P] Configure VitePress sidebar structure in `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` per link-structure contract
- [x] T007 [P] Configure VitePress search settings (enable built-in MiniSearch) in `docs/.vitepress/config.ts`
- [x] T008 [P] Configure syntax highlighting for code blocks (Go, YAML, JSON, Shell) in `docs/.vitepress/config.ts`
- [x] T009 Create home page template in `docs/index.md` with hero section and feature list
- [x] T010 [P] Create stub files for all navigation pages (12 files total across 4 sections) - use placeholder content
- [x] T011 [P] Configure GitHub Pages base URL in `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` (base: '/aether/')
- [x] T012 Skip (VitePress generates static HTML directly, no Jekyll needed)

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ Foundation complete - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Set up VitePress Documentation Site (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Build and verify a functional VitePress documentation site that renders markdown content with navigation and search

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ User Story 1 complete - VitePress site builds, renders, navigates, and searches correctly

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Migrate and Organize Documentation Content (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Consolidate all existing documentation from README.md, specs/, and docs/ into the VitePress site with proper organization and working links

**Independent Test**: All existing documentation accessible from VitePress site with no broken links; content preserved; navigation by role (end-user, developer, operator) works

### Implementation for User Story 2

**Content Migration from Existing Sources**:

- [ ] T026 [US2] Extract and migrate installation/quick-start content from current README.md to `docs/getting-started/` pages

- [ ] T040 [US2] Run comprehensive link validation script (all internal, anchor, and external links)
- [ ] T041 [US2] Verify zero broken links in built site with `npm run docs:build` in `docs/`

**Content Organization & Navigation**:

- [ ] T042 [US2] Create clear user role taxonomy (end-user, developer, operator) and organize sidebar accordingly

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Configure GitHub Pages Deployment (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Automate documentation deployment to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions; ensure updates are live within 3 minutes of push

**Independent Test**: GitHub Actions workflow builds and deploys documentation automatically; site accessible via GitHub Pages; updates appear within 3 minutes of merge to main

### Implementation for User Story 3

**GitHub Actions Workflow Setup**:

- [x] T048 [US3] Create GitHub Actions workflow file at `.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml`
- [x] T049 [US3] Configure workflow trigger for pushes to main branch with docs/ path filter
- [x] T050 [US3] Configure workflow step: Setup Node.js 18.x environment

- [x] T054 [US3] Test workflow file YAML syntax and structure before committing

**GitHub Pages Configuration**:

- [x] T055 [US3] Verify GitHub repository Settings ‚Üí Pages configured to deploy from `gh-pages` branch
- [x] T056 [US3] Ensure site URL in Pages settings matches configuration in `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` (base: '/aether/')
- [x] T057 [US3] Skip (VitePress static output doesn't require Jekyll prevention)

**Deployment Testing**:

- [ ] T058 [US3] Push sample change to main branch to trigger workflow
- [ ] T059 [US3] Monitor GitHub Actions ‚Üí docs-deploy workflow ‚Üí verify build completes within 2 minutes

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately ‚úÖ
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion ‚Üí BLOCKS all user stories
  - Must complete before any story implementation starts
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational completion
  - **US1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational ‚Üí MVP goal
  - **US2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational ‚Üí Content migration
  - **US3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational ‚Üí Deployment automation
  - Stories can proceed in parallel or sequentially
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (VitePress Setup)**: No dependencies on other stories - fully independent
- **US2 (Content Migration)**: No dependencies on other stories - uses US1 as foundation, fully independent
- **US3 (GitHub Deployment)**: No dependencies on other stories - uses US1/US2 as foundation, fully independent

### Within Each Phase

- Phase 1: All [P] tasks can run in parallel
- Phase 2: Tasks ordered by dependencies (config before stub files)
- Phase 3-5: [P] tasks can run in parallel; sequential tasks depend on earlier stages
- Phase 6: [P] tasks can run in parallel; final verification sequential

---

## Parallel Opportunities

### Phase 1 (Setup)
```
T001, T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel (different files/directories)
T005 depends on T001-T004 (uses config.ts location)
```

### Phase 2 (Foundational)
```
T006, T007, T008, T011 can run in parallel (all edit config.ts but independent sections)
T010 can run in parallel (creates stub files)
T009 depends on T005 (home page needs config)
T012 skipped (no Jekyll dependency needed)
```

### Phase 3 (User Story 1)
```
T016, T017, T018, T019 can run in parallel (different content directories)
T020, T021, T025 can run in parallel (link update + build validation)
T022, T023, T024 sequential (require T021 build to be complete)
```

### Phase 3 Example: Parallel Content Creation
```
Developer A: T016 (getting-started section)
Developer B: T017 (guides section)
Developer C: T018 (api-reference section)
Developer D: T019 (development section)
All complete independently, then T020-T025 validate together
```

### Phase 4 (User Story 2)
```
T026-T036 can run in parallel (different source‚Üídestination migrations)
T037-T040 sequential (must audit links, then validate)
T041-T047 sequential (require built site)
```

### Phase 5 (User Story 3)
```
T048-T054 sequential (workflow steps depend on each other)
T055-T057 sequential (setup required before testing)
T058-T063 sequential (deployment steps)
```

### Phase 6 (Polish)
```
T064-T069 can run in parallel (validation tasks)
T070-T075 sequential (final checks)
```

## Task Completion Tracking

**Total Tasks**: 75
**By Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 5 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 7 tasks
- Phase 3 (US1): 13 tasks
- Phase 4 (US2): 22 tasks
- Phase 5 (US3): 16 tasks
- Phase 6 (Polish): 12 tasks

**By Parallelization**:
- [P] Parallelizable: 28 tasks
- Sequential: 47 tasks

**MVP Scope** (Phase 1 + 2 + 3): 25 tasks = ~2-3 days effort
**Full Scope** (All phases): 75 tasks = ~1 week effort

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = can run in parallel (different directories/files, no dependencies)
- [Story] label (US1, US2, US3) maps task to user story for traceability
- Each user story can be completed and tested independently
- Commits recommended after each phase completion or logical task group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate that story works independently
- Avoid: combining sequential tasks in parallel, cross-story dependencies that break independence
