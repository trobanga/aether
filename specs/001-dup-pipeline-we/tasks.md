# Tasks: DUP Pipeline CLI (Aether)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-dup-pipeline-we/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (‚úì), spec.md (‚úì), research.md (‚úì), data-model.md (‚úì), contracts/ (‚úì)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-08 (FR-029 progress indicator requirements integrated)

**Tests**: Tests are included per TDD requirement from constitution (plan.md Phase II confirmation)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**FR-029 Updates**: Added 6 tasks for progress indicator implementation:
- T020-T022: UI infrastructure (ProgressBar, Spinner, ETA, Throughput calculators)
- T023-T024: UI component tests
- T032, T034, T038: Progress integration in User Story 1
- Updated US4 tasks for progress displays
- T082, T090: FR-029 validation in Polish phase

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Import)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2 - Resumption)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3 - DIMP)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US1 import data but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4 - Conversion)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Can use US1 or US3 data, independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD requirement)
- Models before services
- Services before pipeline orchestration
- Pipeline orchestration before CLI commands
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

#### Setup Phase (Phase 1)
All tasks except T001-T002 can run in parallel after project structure exists.

#### Foundational Phase (Phase 2)
```bash
# All models can run in parallel:
T007 (job.go), T008 (step.go), T009 (file.go), T010 (config.go)

# All services can run in parallel after models:
T013 (config.go), T014 (state.go), T018 (httpclient.go), T019 (logging.go)

# All lib utilities can run in parallel:
T015 (retry.go), T016 (fhir.go)

# All UI infrastructure can run in parallel:
T020 (progress.go), T021 (eta.go), T022 (throughput.go)
```

#### User Story Parallelization
Once Phase 2 completes, all user stories (Phase 3-6) can start in parallel if team capacity allows:
- Developer A: User Story 1 (Import) - T023-T039
- Developer B: User Story 2 (Resumption) - T040-T051
- Developer C: User Story 3 (DIMP) - T052-T062
- Developer D: User Story 4 (Conversion) - T063-T077

#### Within User Story 1
```bash
# All tests can run in parallel:
T023 (progress_bar_test.go), T024 (eta_test.go), T025 (import_local_test.go),
T026 (import_url_test.go), T027 (pipeline_import_local_test.go),
T028 (pipeline_import_url_test.go), T029 (pipeline_import_error_test.go)

# Implementation services can run in parallel:
T030 (importer.go), T031 (downloader.go)
```

#### Within User Story 3
```bash
# All tests can run in parallel:
T052, T053, T054, T055
```

#### Within User Story 4
```bash
# All tests can run in parallel:
T063, T064, T065, T066, T067, T068

# CSV and Parquet implementation can run in parallel:
T070 (csv_conversion.go), T071 (parquet_conversion.go)
```

#### Polish Phase (Phase 7)
Most tasks marked [P] can run in parallel.

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Contract test for local directory import in tests/unit/import_local_test.go"
Task: "Contract test for HTTP URL download in tests/unit/import_url_test.go"
Task: "Integration test for full import workflow (local path) in tests/integration/pipeline_import_local_test.go"
Task: "Integration test for full import workflow (HTTP URL) in tests/integration/pipeline_import_url_test.go"
Task: "Integration test for invalid input source in tests/integration/pipeline_import_error_test.go"

# Launch implementation services together:
Task: "Implement file import service for local paths in internal/services/importer.go"
Task: "Implement file download service for HTTP URLs in internal/services/downloader.go"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T006)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T007-T022) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories, includes UI infrastructure
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T023-T039) - includes progress indicators
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently, verify FR-029 compliance (progress bars, ETA, throughput)
5. Deploy/demo if ready - basic import functionality with visual feedback works!

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (T001-T022) ‚Üí Foundation ready, UI infrastructure in place
2. Add User Story 1 (T023-T039) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP: Import with progress indicators!)
3. Add User Story 2 (T040-T051) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Added: Resumption!)
4. Add User Story 3 (T052-T062) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Added: Pseudonymization!)
5. Add User Story 4 (T063-T077) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Added: Format conversion with progress!)
6. Polish (T078-T092) ‚Üí Final release with FR-029 validation
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T022) - includes UI infrastructure
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 - Import (T023-T039) - includes progress indicators
   - Developer B: User Story 2 - Resumption (T040-T051)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 - DIMP (T052-T062)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 - Conversion (T063-T077) - includes progress displays
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team collaborates on Polish phase (T078-T092) - includes FR-029 validation

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 92 (was 86, added 6 for FR-029 progress indicator requirements)
- **Phase 1 - Setup**: 6 tasks ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Phase 2 - Foundational**: 16 tasks ‚úÖ COMPLETE (added 3 UI infrastructure tasks T020-T022)

- **Phase 7 - Polish**: 15 tasks ‚úÖ COMPLETE (15/15) - All polish tasks complete including T079-T091

**Test Tasks**: 21 (per TDD requirement) - added 2 UI component tests
**Parallel Tasks**: 47 marked with [P] - increased due to UI infrastructure

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (User Story 1 only) = 39 tasks (was 33)

**FR-029 Integration**: Progress indicators integrated across all phases:
- Foundational: Base UI infrastructure (ProgressBar, Spinner, ETA, Throughput calculators)
- US1: Download progress bars, file import progress, spinners for connections
- US2: Status formatting with UI components
- US3: DIMP processing progress (via existing infrastructure)
- US4: Conversion progress bars and spinners
- Polish: FR-029 compliance validation tasks

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Follow Go naming conventions (CamelCase for exported, camelCase for unexported)
- Use value semantics for immutable structs per functional programming principles
- All HTTP services use retry logic for transient errors only
- All state changes create new instances (no mutations)
