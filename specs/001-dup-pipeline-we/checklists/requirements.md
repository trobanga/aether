# Specification Quality Checklist: DUP Pipeline CLI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Refinement**: Progress indicator acceptance criteria (FR-029)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- Spec properly avoids implementation details in requirements
- One assumption (line 162) mentions Go libraries (`schollz/progressbar`, `cheggaaa/pb`) but clearly marked as implementation guidance, not requirement
- All user scenarios focus on user value and outcomes

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- FR-029 now has precise, testable acceptance criteria (FR-029a through FR-029e)
- ETA calculation formula explicitly defined: `ETA = (total_items - processed_items) * avg_time_per_item`
- Update frequency specified: at least every 2 seconds
- Visual format specified: progress bars for known progress, spinners for unknown duration
- Display components specified: percentage, elapsed time, ETA, throughput rate, operation name, items processed/total
- SC-006 updated to align with FR-029 requirements

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- User Story 1, Scenario 2 enhanced with explicit progress indicator expectations
- FR-029 sub-requirements (a-e) provide comprehensive, testable acceptance criteria
- SC-006 now measurable: "updates at least every 2 seconds, showing completion percentage, elapsed time, ETA, and throughput rate"

## Refinement Impact Analysis

### Changes Made
1. **FR-029 expanded** from single vague requirement to 5 detailed sub-requirements (FR-029a through FR-029e)
2. **SC-006 clarified** with specific metrics replacing "real-time updates at least every 10 seconds" with "updates at least every 2 seconds"
3. **Assumption added** for implementation guidance on Go library choice
4. **User Story 1 enhanced** with explicit progress indicator expectations in acceptance scenario 2

### Analysis Findings Addressed
- **U2 (HIGH - Underspecification)**: ✅ RESOLVED - FR-029 now fully specifies format, update frequency, calculation methods, and display components
- **A1 (MEDIUM - Ambiguity)**: ✅ RESOLVED - ETA calculation formula explicitly defined
- **A2 (MEDIUM - Ambiguity)**: ✅ RESOLVED - Update frequency changed from 10s to 2s, aligning with status query <2s requirement

### Remaining Analysis Issues (Not in Scope of This Refinement)
- **U1**: Config file missing/malformed behavior - not addressed (separate concern)
- **U3**: Validation step placeholder task - not addressed (separate concern)
- **I1**: Viper flag override mechanism - not addressed (plan.md concern)
- **I2**: Error classification design - not addressed (plan.md concern)
- **C1**: File locking edge case linkage - not addressed (tasks.md concern)
- **C2**: Malformed FHIR resource validation scope - not addressed (separate concern)

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: ✅ EXCELLENT
**Refinement Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` (no spec blockers remain)

This refinement successfully addresses the HIGH priority underspecification issue (U2) identified in the analysis report. FR-029 is now fully testable with clear acceptance criteria covering:
- Format (progress bars vs spinners)
- Update frequency (2 seconds)
- Display components (percentage, ETA, throughput, operation name, items)
- Calculation methods (ETA formula with explicit averaging window)

The refined specification maintains technology-agnostic requirements while providing sufficient detail for implementation planning.
