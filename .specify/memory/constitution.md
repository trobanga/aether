# Aether Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Functional Programming

The codebase MUST favor functional programming paradigms:

- **Immutability**: Data structures MUST be immutable by default. Use records, final fields, and immutable collections.
- **Pure Functions**: Functions MUST be pure whenever possible—same inputs always produce same outputs, no side effects.
- **Explicit Side Effects**: Side effects (I/O, mutations, external calls) MUST be isolated, clearly marked, and pushed to boundaries.
- **Function Composition**: Complex logic MUST be built from composing small, single-purpose functions.
- **No Hidden State**: Functions MUST NOT depend on or modify hidden/global state.

**Rationale**: Functional code is easier to test, reason about, parallelize, and refactor. Pure functions are predictable and composable, reducing cognitive load and defects.

### II. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

TDD is **NON-NEGOTIABLE**:

- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Tests MUST be written first, MUST fail (RED), then implementation makes them pass (GREEN), then refactor.
- **User Approval**: Test scenarios MUST be reviewed and approved before implementation begins.
- **No Implementation Without Tests**: Code written without prior failing tests MUST be rejected in code review.
- **Test Coverage**: Every functional requirement MUST have corresponding test coverage (unit, integration, or contract tests as appropriate).

**Rationale**: TDD ensures requirements are clear, code is testable by design, and regressions are caught early. It enforces discipline and produces living documentation.

### III. Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)

Simplicity is a first-class requirement:

- **Start Simple**: Choose the simplest solution that solves the immediate problem. Avoid premature optimization and over-engineering.
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Do NOT add features, abstractions, or complexity for speculative future needs.
- **Complexity Justification**: Any abstraction layer, pattern, or architectural complexity MUST be explicitly justified in writing before adoption.
- **Clear Over Clever**: Code MUST prioritize clarity and readability over cleverness or brevity.
- **Delete Before Adding**: Before adding new code, consider if existing code can be simplified or removed.

**Rationale**: Simple systems are easier to understand, maintain, debug, and evolve. Complexity is a liability that compounds over time.

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Requirements

- **All changes** MUST go through pull request review
- **TDD compliance** MUST be verified: reviewer checks tests exist and were written first
- **Functional purity** MUST be validated: reviewer flags unnecessary mutations or side effects
- **Simplicity check** MUST occur: reviewer challenges any unjustified complexity

### Test Discipline

- **Contract tests**: Required for new library interfaces or API contracts
- **Integration tests**: Required for cross-boundary interactions (external services, databases, file systems)
- **Unit tests**: Required for all business logic and pure functions
- **Test isolation**: Tests MUST NOT depend on execution order or shared mutable state

### Complexity Escalation

When a solution appears to violate KISS:

1. Document the problem being solved
2. Explain why simpler alternatives are insufficient
3. Get explicit approval before proceeding
4. Add comments justifying the complexity

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices and conventions. All code, architecture decisions, and development processes MUST comply with these principles.

### Amendment Process

- Constitution changes require written proposal with justification
- Amendments MUST include migration plan for affected code
- Version MUST be incremented following semantic versioning:
  - **MAJOR**: Backward incompatible governance changes, principle removals/redefinitions
  - **MINOR**: New principles added or materially expanded guidance
  - **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review

- Pull requests MUST be checked against constitution principles
- Code reviews MUST reject violations (unless explicitly justified and approved)
- Architecture decisions MUST reference constitution principles in their rationale

### Living Document

This constitution is a living document. Principles should evolve with the project's understanding, but changes must be deliberate and documented.
